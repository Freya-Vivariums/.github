A vivarium brings the tranquility and rythms of the natural world into your living space. It fosters a deep human connection to nature by introducing an authentic living presence into our modern life.

The **Freya Vivarium Control System** helps manage and maintain the environment within your vivarium, using advanced climate control to support natural cycles. By processing data from sensors within the vivarium, such as temperature, humidity and light levels, Freya calculates the necessary actions for the actuators - such as heaters, humidifiers and lighting - to maintain the desired conditions.

#### Features
- **Climate control** for several environment variables, mimicing the natural environment.
- **Configurable cycles** for simulating day/night and seasonal changes.
- **Set it and forget it** by design. Operating quietly in the background, maintaining optimal conditions

### Alternate usecases
- **Greenhouse automation** and precision agriculture for optimized plant growth.
- **Distributed research** on the effects of climate(change) and the adaptability of living organisms.
- **Nature preservation** by providing controlled habitats for species from endagered environments.
